            <h1>Basic information</h1>
            <p>Dragons are very intellagent creatures but they do have a firey temper. This means that you
               don't want to stand too close when they are angry. However thet are also very loyal to their owners
               and will protect them.</p>
          </div>
          <div class='col-sm-4'>
            <h1> shelter</h1>
            <p> Dragons need large enclosures, including space to stretch their wings. We recommend that you line
              the enclosure with bricks or some form of fireproof material. Usually pet dragons only breath fire when stressed or told to do so
             but accidents happen and you want to be prepared by Keeping buckets of water nearby.</p>

            Also like all pets they need to drink so for a drink they have special water which thet can braught in some
          pet shops. </p>
